# To Do List In React

This is solely trying to learn the basics of React again

## Functionality

- Create Task Entity
  - Task Name describes the task
  - Task Time Frame describes the amount of time it'll take to complete
- Delete Task Entity
  - Deletes the specified task
- Data Persistance
  - Uses local storage in order to retain the information of the tasks through a refresh / reboot

## Purpose

This very simple project was used in order to refresh my understanding of how React works after working in Vue for a bit. By completing a simple project, I was able to remember the basic structure, and can apply it to working on larger tasks.

# Technologies Used

- NPM
- Vite
- React
- Material UI

# Final Notes

This is legitimately just trying to remember the framework that is React, the aesthetics of the project are extremely simple / nonexistent.
